# AMO Validator Bypass Proof of Concept

This is a trivial Firefox extension that performs three potentially malicious tasks but would nevertheless be automatically signed by the addons.mozilla.org validator.

For context, see [Automated Scanning of Firefox Extensions is Security Theater](http://danstillman.com/2015/11/23/firefox-extension-scanning-is-security-theater).

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/dstillman/amo-validator-bypass.git`
2. Running a dev build? Don't forget to set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to false! Fortunately that wouldn't be necessary once this was automatically signed…
3. Create a text file named `amo-validator-bypass@example.net` in your Firefox profile's `extensions` directory containing the path to the cloned repo.
4. Start Firefox.

## Running

### Data exfiltration

1. Start netcat listening on a local port:

  ```
  % nc -l 11111
  ```

2. Load http://test.webdav.org/auth-basic/ or any Basic Auth–protected site and enter any username and password.

Your Base64-encoded username and password should show up in the netcat output. This could be any other sensitive data, and it could just as easily be POSTed to a remote server.

### Local process execution

(The default executable is available only on OS X. Feel free to sub in another program for your platform.)

- Load https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/02/10/extension-signing-safer-experience/

An OS X system dialog should appear, spawned via the `osascript` command-line tool.

### Remote code execution

1. Start an HTTP server in the `remote` directory of the local repo:

  ```
  % cd remote
  % python -m SimpleHTTPServer 11112
  ```

2. Load https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/04/15/the-case-for-extension-signing/

An alert will appear showing the path to the Firefox profile directory. This alert is generated by unvalidated remote code that runs with full privileges.

## Validating

Via the [command line](https://github.com/mozilla/amo-validator):

```
% ./build.sh
% amo-validator --selfhosted -v ../bypass.xpi

Summary:
